# Balathumb

This is a simple tool for generating thumbnails for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) videos. Mostly made for myself, but feel free to use for your own videos too!

Assets and shaders were ripped from a legal copy of the game. Font is [m6x11](https://managore.itch.io/m6x11) by Daniel Linssen.

## Roadmap
- [ ] More backgrounds
- [ ] More customizability with joker placements
- [ ] Add playing cards & consumables
